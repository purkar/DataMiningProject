For this project, I choose the dataset which is available on Kaggle. The link for the dataset is

The dataset is organized into 3 folders train, test and val. Each folder contains a subfolder for
normal chest X-rays and chest X-rays infected with pneumonia. There is total 5,863 X-ray
images (JPEG) each image is of resolution 2090 X 1858 the resulting image vector after
converting to array will be of shape 1 X 3.8 million. The subfolders having pneumonia images
has both the viral and bacterial pneumonia images.
